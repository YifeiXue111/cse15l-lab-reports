# Lab Report1
1. Example of using the command with no arguments
```
[user@sahara ~]$ ls  
lecture1  
```
The working directory was /home when the command was run.  
ls lists the files in the current working directory, and lecture1 is the only file in the working directory, so it is shown.  
This output is not an error.  

```
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd  
/home  
```
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd  
```
