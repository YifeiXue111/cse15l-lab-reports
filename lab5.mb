Hi! I met a problem when working with the copyArray method. This method takes an array as input, copy the input array to another array and then change the value of the first element. It is expected to return the copy of the original input array. But when I run the Junit test, the test fails and shows that the first element of the returned array is also changed. I think the problem is when I changed the value of input array, the value of the returned array is changed accordingly. I am pretty confused why the returned array is affected by the input array. Could you help me figure out why this happens? Thank you for your help.
